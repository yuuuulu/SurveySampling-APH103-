## Drawing Stratified Random Samples

## Estimation of Population Means and Totals

## Sample Size Allocation Rules

## Estimating Population Proportions

## Comparison with Simple Random Sampling

Different information is obtained from
different Strata and each Stratum is studied
independently.

A good stratification results in
a more accurate estimate than
a simple random sampling.

A proper stratification
will reduce sampling
error

5.19

The investigator decides to stratify on months in the sampling inspection in order to observe month-to-month variation. Simple random samples of battery weights for the two month A and B are yielded.Estimate the average weight of the batteries in the population (shipment), and place a bound on the error of estimation. Ignore the fpc. The manufacturing standard for this type of battery is 65 pounds. Do you think this shipment meets the standard on the average? 




$\bar y_A = 63.47$
$\bar y_B = 64,3$

$\bar y = (63.47+64.3)/2 = 63.885$

$SD_A = \sqrt{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}()}$

$SD_B = \sqrt{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}()}$



The overall standard deviation (( s )) can be estimated using the formula for pooled standard deviation: $$s = \sqrt{\frac{(n_A - 1)s_A^2 + (n_B - 1)s_B^2}{n_A + n_B - 2}}$$ Where ( n_A = n_B = 6 )

Step 5: Calculate the Margin of Error

The margin of error (E) can be calculated using the formula: $$E = t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$ Assuming a 95% confidence level and using ( $t \approx 2.262$ ) for ( n = 12 ): $$E = 2.262 \cdot \frac{1.087}{\sqrt{12}} \approx 2.262 \cdot 0.313 \approx 0.709$$

Step 6: Confidence Interval for the Mean
The confidence interval for the mean weight of the batteries is: $$\bar{x} \pm E = 67.215 \pm 0.709$$ This gives: $$(66.506, 67.924)$$

Conclusion
The estimated average weight of the batteries in the shipment is approximately 67.215 pounds, with a 95% confidence interval of (66.506, 67.924) pounds.

Does the Shipment Meet the Standard?
The manufacturing standard for this type of battery is 65 pounds. Since the entire confidence interval (66.506 to 67.924) is above 65 pounds, we can conclude that this shipment meets the manufacturing standard on average.




5.20

In Exercise 5.19, do you think stratifying on month is desirable, or would simple random sampling work just as well? Assume that taking a simple random sample is just as con- venient as taking a stratified random sample.


Solution:

see the photo on my phone, which just compared the variances of SRS and stratified sampling.


5.21


A quality control inspector must estimate the proportion of defective microcomputer chips coming from two different assembly operations. She knows that, among the chips in the lot to be inspected, 60% are from assembly operation A and 40% are from assem- bly operation B. In a random sample of 100 chips, 38 turn out to be from operation A and 62 from operation B. Among the sampled chips from operation A, six are defective. Among the sampled chips from operation B, ten are defective.


a. Considering only the simple random sample of 100 chips,estimate the proportion of defectives in the lot, and place a bound on the error of estimation.

Solution:


1. Operation A : $\hat p_A = \frac{6}{38} \approx 0.1579$

   Operation B : $\hat p_B = \frac{10}{62} \approx 0.1613$

2. $W_A=0.6$

   $W_B=0.4$
   
   Overall : $\hat p_{st} = W_A \cdot \hat p_A + W_B \cdot \hat p_B = 0.15926$
   
3. The standard error of the estimate can be calculated using the formula for the standard error of a proportion: $$SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1 - \hat p)}{n}}$$

   Where ( $\hat p$ ) is the estimated proportion and ( n ) is the sample size.
   
   Overall: $SE_{st} = \sqrt{(W_A^2 \cdot SE_A^2) + (W_B^2 \cdot SE_B^2)} \approx 0.0401$
   
   95% CI: $\hat p_{st} \pm 1.96 \cdot SE_{st} = 0.15926 \pm 1.96 \cdot 0.0401$
   







b. Stratifying the sample, after selection, into chips from operation A and B, estimate the proportion of defectives in the population, and place a bound on the error of estimation. Ignore the fpc in both cases. Which answers do you find more acceptable?



Poststratification is a method of stratifying a sample after it has been selected. In this case, the sample of 100 chips has already been selected, and we will now stratify it into chips from operation A and B.

# 5.3 --a good example of showing why we use poststatification


 The CARS93 data, in Appendix C, has cars classified as to being one of six different types, small, compact, midsize, large, sporty, or van. A numerical type code is given in the data set, in addition to the actual name of the type. The goal of this activity is to see if poststratification on car type pays any dividends when estimating average city gasoline mileage or proportion of cars with air bags for the cars in this population.
 
 
a. Select a random sample of cars from this population. Estimate the average city miles per gallon (mpg) for these cars, with a bound on the error of estimation.


b. Estimate the proportion of these cars that have at least one air bag, with a bound on the error of estimation.


c. Using the data from part (a), poststratify on the car type and then estimate the average city mpg by this method.


d. Using the data from part (b), poststratify on car type and then estimate the proportion of cars that have at least one air bag by this method.


e. Comparing the above results, comment on when poststratification might produce big gains in terms of the error of estimation.

We now move from selecting samples from real sets of data to selecting samples from
probability distributions. The probability distributions partially given in the following
table represent the heights of adults in America. The complete set of data is available via
a link from electronic Section 5.0. PROB-M denotes the probabilities of various heights
(in inches) for males, PROB-F denotes the probabilities for females, and PROB denotes the
combined probabilities for adults. The goal is to select samples from these distributions to
compare estimates of the average height from stratified random sampling to estimates from
simple random sampling

a. Use the discrete distributions sampling tool (available via a link in electronic
Section 5.0) to produce random samples from specified discrete distributions.


b. Select a random sample of 20 male heights and a separate random sample of 20 female
heights. From these data, estimate the average height of all adults and calculate a bound
on the error of estimation. (Assume that approximately 50% of adults are male.)


c. Select a simple random sample of 40 heights for the height distribution of adults.
From these data, estimate the average height of all adults and calculate a bound on the
error of estimation.


d. Repeat steps (b) and (c) a number of times, so as to generate a sampling distribution
of estimates in each case.


e. Compare the results of (b) and (c). Comment on when stratification seems to produce
gains in precision of estimates.

# Systematic Sampling


## Concept

the first sample determines all the remaining sample points

 - 

 - 

 - 

1-in-k systematic sample 

k is the sample interval

### Eg

Example 4.11 N=36, k=6


SRS (n=1)

i = 3

i+k=9

...


i+5k=32 now we stop since N=36

Conclusion: this is an alternative to simple random samples


  - Advantage: 
  
   - Easy to implement
   
   
   - Reducing researcher selection error
   
   - Systematic sampling allows more information to be obtained at the same cost
   
   - Can substitute for simple random samples in the absence of a complete sampling frame
   
   


## Implementation of it

### 1-k systematic samples can use different sampling intervals k


1. Sample n systematic samples from N totals, 

k ≤ N/n


2. If the number of populations N is unknown and thus k cannot be found precisely, the researcher can decide on an approximate sample size n and guess the value of k.


3. If the value of k i chosen to be too large, then it may not be possible to obtain a 1-k systematic sample with a sample size of n.


4. The number of populations N is not a multiple f the sampling interval k, which can result in systematic samples with different sample sizes.

## relationship between Systematic Sampling and Cluster Sampling

no unbiased estimator -- do some verification







### Stratified non-random sampling




## Point estimate of the population mean


$N =ML = \hat{\bar Y}=\bar y_{sy} = 1/L \sum_{i=1}^L y_i$




follow the idea of simple random sampling




## modified systematic sampling




Guaranteed unbiased estimates


Requires known population size N
